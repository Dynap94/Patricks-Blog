It does seem that I have some ingrained sense of guilt. That I need to prove my worth.  If nothing else, self imposed pain/discomfort is the bare minimum necessary for earning my right to exist and consume at the scale that is typical in my time, location, and place in society.  That if I don't achieve some level of output, that I'm some sort of freeloader.  A 'waste' of all of the input resources I've consumed.  That all of the sacrifice and love those before me  provided was for nothing. I don't feel like a man living up to my "duty".

On the other hand, I can't think of much things more courageous and worthy of admiration than one who truly puts the social 'oughts' aside and takes stock of their values and desires and then attempts to craft a life in that image.  The vision and creation seem like the difficult part.  But the more I think about it, it seems like casting away the oughts may be the most difficult.  Letting go of the oughts is fully opening yourself up to fear.
